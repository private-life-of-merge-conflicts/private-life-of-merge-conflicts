## Private Life of Merge Conflicts
### Abstract

> Collaborative development is an essential process for the success of software projects. However, code integration conflicts can occur when developers push and merge their changes to the shared repository. Such conflicts may impair developers' productivity and introduce new bugs. Previous empirical studies have analyzed these conflict characteristics and proposed different approaches to prevent or resolve them. However, they did not consider the local actions or the integration scenarios usually omitted from the history of remote shared repositories due to using commands, such as rebase, that rewrite Git commits history. Thus,  these studies might be examining only part of the integration scenarios and conflicts. In this paper, we try to shed some light on this problem by bringing evidence from an empirical study with data extracted from private repositories of developers to identify integration scenarios, focusing on hidden integration scenarios. We analyzed 95 log files belonging to 61 different developers. Our results indicate that hidden integration scenarios are more frequent than the visible ones in the private repositories. We also found higher conflict rates than previous studies did. Thus, our evidence suggests that studies might be losing integration conflict data by not including the developer's local repository actions.
